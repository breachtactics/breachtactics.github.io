## Overview
Inspired by [IntelTechniques](https://inteltechniques.com/tools/) OSINT resources, the following Search Tools were 
created to simplify reconnaissance during authorized security testing and bug bounty hunting. 

The following input fields are used to populate "pre-canned" search queries that can help identify new assets, 
perform vulnerability identification, or find new information about a target domain.

> **NOTE**: All search items are opened in a new, dedicated browser tab using client-side JavaScript. No data is
