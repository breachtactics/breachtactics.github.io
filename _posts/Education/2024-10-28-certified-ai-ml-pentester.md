As organizations race to adopt the latest in artificial intelligence (AI), I was looking for training that addressed its unique attack surface and tested my skills in exploiting large language models (LLM). That’s when I discovered [The SecOps Group](https://secops.group) and their [Certified AI/ML Pentester](https://secops.group/product/certified-ai-ml-pentester/), which was one of the first certifications (I've seen*) to offer a practical exam on LLM exploitation. 

This post outlines my experience passing the [C-AI/MLPen](https://secops.group/product/certified-ai-ml-pentester/) and 
provides helpful resources used to navigate The SecOps Group's new "exam-only" training model.

# Preparation
Initially, I was thrown by The SecOps Group's new exam-only approach, removing formal training and requiring 100% self-study — especially when navigating a complex topic like LLM exploitation. However, the [Exam Syllabus](https://secops.group/product/certified-ai-ml-pentester/#Exam-Syllabus) listed each topic covered, along with links to resources from industry leaders in AI such as [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/red-teaming), [Nvidia](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ai-red-team-an-introduction/), and [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/prompt-injection). 

I spent a significant amount of time brushing up on advanced exploitation techniques such as direct/indirect prompt injection, training data manipulation, RAG poisoning, and vulnerabilities in LLM design. Most of my effort, however, were focused on practical challenges using platforms like [Gandalf](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/), [Immersive Labs](https://prompting.ai.immersivelabs.com/), and [Crucible](https://crucible.dreadnode.io/).

Through each CTF challenge, I concentrated on "why" rather than "how"; evaluating the models core functionality and identifying preventative controls such as output generation rules or input/output filters. I equated this to "reconnaissance" in a standard pentest methodology before moving onto "exploitation". This made it much easier to craft jailbreaks, exploit excessive functionality, and extract sensitive information once I knew the extent of the LLMs current instructions.

I finished studying with SecOps [Mock Exam](https://secops.group/free-mock-pentesting-exams/), which contained two challenges and used the same format as the real exam. Anyone looking for a good challenge should checkout level 2, which introduced a chatbot named Ultron communicating **only** in emojis and prone to hallucinations! 🌍💀🦠

# The Exam
Overall the exam was super straightforward. Students are given 4 hours to work through 8 different AI models and extract a secret key. Submit these keys in the exam portal and click submit when done... no reporting, notes, or other documentation requirements. 

Each AI model in the exam has a specific point allocation and students are required to get 60% or higher to pass — meaning you *should* be safe with at least 6/8 challenges but pay attention!!

# Conclusion
Overall, I had a great experience with the [C-AI/MLPen](https://secops.group/product/certified-ai-ml-pentester/) and would recommend it for anyone looking to expand their knowledge in AI/ML security. It was a great intermediate level primer and I'm excited to see other trainings on the subject.

> *Full disclosure* - The SecOps Group provided me with an exam attempt to review the course. However, my experience was largely positive and I would recommend it regardless! The C-AI/MLPen provided a lot of fun challenges and, with ongoing [discounts](https://secops.group/pentesting-exams/offers/), can be found for only ~$65!
